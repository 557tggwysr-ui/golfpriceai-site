GolfPrice AI — automated catalog refresh script.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Runs on a schedule (see .github/workflows/update-deals.yml), pulls current
products from your affiliate networks, and merges them into the full
catalog at data/products.json — adding new products, updating prices on
existing ones (matched by name), and leaving everything else untouched.
The website itself never changes — it just reads whatever is in that file.
This is the "hands-off" pipeline, and it scales to hundreds of products
without any further site changes.

WHY IT USES AFFILIATE NETWORK FEEDS INSTEAD OF SCRAPING RETAILERS DIRECTLY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scraping retailer websites (including Amazon) directly violates their
Terms of Service and risks the account being banned — this script will
never do that, regardless of how tempting a shortcut it might seem. The
networks below give you legitimate, ToS-compliant product + price data
because you're a registered affiliate with them.

This also solves the "wrong photo, dead link" problem for good: every
product a network's feed returns already comes with (a) the retailer's own
licensed product photo and (b) a working, trackable affiliate link baked
in. The front-end (js/app.js, js/shop.js) already prefers a real photo
over the placeholder icon whenever one is present, so nothing else needs
to change on the site itself once real data starts flowing in.

CURRENT STATUS (as of last update)
-----------------------------------
- Amazon: no live price data yet (Product Advertising API unlocks after 3
  tracked sales) — existing Amazon search links in the catalog keep working
  regardless; this script doesn't touch them.
- CJ Affiliate: credentials are set, but no advertiser joined yet — returns
  nothing until that changes.
- AWIN: credentials are set, applications pending approval — returns
  nothing until an AWIN_ADVERTISER_ID secret is added for an approved
  retailer.

SETUP YOU NEED TO DO ONCE MORE THINGS ARE APPROVED (see README.md):
1. Once a CJ advertiser is joined, or an AWIN application is approved,
   come back to a Claude chat and the matching fetch_* function below gets
   finished off in a few minutes using the real API/feed docs.
2. Nothing else changes — this script already knows how to merge whatever
   it finds into the live catalog.
